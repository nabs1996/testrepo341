# Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a website similar to an Instagram platform.

# Project
This web application's main function allows users to post pictures and videos that they want to share with other people. This will allow them to get feedback in the form of comments and ratings. If they find other users and enjoy their posts, they will be able to subscribe to them in order to get notified when that user posts something new.
